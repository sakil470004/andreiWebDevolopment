You will get a prompt that says “Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?” Click <strong>Yes</strong>.<br><br><strong>3.</strong> Run through the installer: We will use the default settings for everything in this installation, so all you need to do now is keep clicking <strong>Next</strong>, and finally <strong>Finish</strong>. <em>(If you want more details on what each option does, you can read about it </em><a href="https://www.sitereq.com/post/easiest-way-to-install-git-bash-commands-on-windows" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>here and read the Git Bash Windows Installation section</em></a><em>)<br><br></em><strong>4.</strong> Congratulations! You have just finished the setup. You can now open <strong>“Git Bash”</strong> from your computer so you can follow the lesson in the next video.&nbsp;You now have the same setup as any Mac or Linux user where we call this the "Terminal".<br><br>Ps Windows has recently announced that you will be able to download an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actual Terminal from their online store for free</a>. </p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
