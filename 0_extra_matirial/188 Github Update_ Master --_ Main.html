In the next video we are going to be speaking about&nbsp;Github and branching. Recently Github has decided to rename the original branch from <code>master</code> to <code>main</code> .&nbsp;If you want to find out the reason why they did this, you can read about it <a href="https://github.com/github/renaming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;<em>(main is less offensive than master).<br><br></em>For this reason, for any new Github repositories created from now on <em>(old ones will stay the same with master as the main branch)</em>, you will have to use <code>main</code> instead of <code>master</code>. So anytime you see me use master, simply replace it with main in the next video!<br><br>For example if you see a command like:<br><code>git push origin master</code><br><br>it should now be:<br><code>git push origin main</code> </p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
