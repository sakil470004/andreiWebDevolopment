In order to connect students who are looking for jobs with these recruiters, I have created a simple website where you can list your information and your portfolio. This way, I can just forward these requests to this page for recruiters to check you out. This is completely optional and I hope some students will be&nbsp;able to get jobs this way.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>You can check out the website here:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://alumni-board.netlify.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://alumni-board.netlify.app/"><strong>https://alumni-board.netlify.app/</strong></a><br><br>By the way, this is a project that is open sourced, and can be improved upon by the community and you can add your own profile to it.
