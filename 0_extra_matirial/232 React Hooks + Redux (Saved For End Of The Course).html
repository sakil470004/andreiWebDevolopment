At the end of the course we are going to learn about<strong> React Hooks</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong>. I have moved the lectures for these topics to the end, since these topics are quite advanced and we need to learn a little more about other subjects like Asynchronous code. For this reason, I recommend that you keep going through the course in order, and once we finish our final SmartBrain project, and ONLY&nbsp;THEN, continue to the 2 sections at the bottom <em>(just follow the lecture order I&nbsp;have created here for you inside the course)<br></em><br><br>We will revisit these two sections later:<strong><em><br>Extra Learning: React Hooks<br>Extra Learning: Redux</em></strong><br></p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
