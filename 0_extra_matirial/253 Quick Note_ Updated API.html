In the next video you are going to learn about Clarifai API. <br><br><strong>1. I have added a troubleshooting video for you to watch after the next one</strong>: <em>Clarifai API Updates, Models and Troubleshooting. </em>This video will go over some of the Clarifai Website updates plus some common errors that students might get in the next video. One thing you will notice is that for marketing reasons, they have changed their <em>Predict</em> model we will be using to <em>Armada Predict</em>...ohhh fancy!<br><br><strong>2. Sometimes the Clarifai Models can be down or not working as they are constantly getting updated.</strong> A good way to check if the model you are using is up, is to check them on the clarifai website. For example, for the Face Detect Mode: <a href="https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection</a>. If that isn't working, then that means you will have to wait until their servers are back up. Another solution is to use a different version of their model that works like this one: `c0c0ac362b03416da06ab3fa36fb58e3`.<br><br>So compared to what you might see in the next video you might have to enter the above key:</p><p> so you would change from in the video:</p><p><code>.predict(Clarifai.FACE_DETECT_MODEL, this.state.input)</code></p><p> to:</p><p><code>.predict('c0c0ac362b03416da06ab3fa36fb58e3', this.state.input)</code></p><p><br><br>You will see when you get there in the next video :)<br></p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
