Up until now, the code worked just fine on your computer. But what happens when we now move the code from our computers to somewhere in the world on a "server" that has a different setup than our home computers?<br><br>Because of this, in this section you will encounter many errors, and it will test your ability to research, debug, and understand why your code isn't working on Heroku. <strong>It may become frustrating, but trust me on this, that this is a good learning experience and you WILL get there.</strong> To help you out along the way, watch the next couple of videos and you can also use this guide as a reference on a different way to do it if the path I&nbsp;outlined for you in the next videos produces errors for you: </p><p><strong>For Frontend React code:</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/quick-code/deploying-production-build-of-react-app-to-heroku-2548d8bf6936" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://medium.com/quick-code/deploying-production-build-of-react-app-to-heroku-2548d8bf6936</a><strong><br>For Backend code: </strong><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs</a><br><br><strong>For example, here is a sneak peak:</strong><br>In the next video, we will be deploying our app to Heroku. Some student may encounter an error while doing this which will state (in the logs):</p><p><code>nodemon: not found</code></p><p>On Heroku, dev dependencies never get installed. However <strong>nodemon</strong> is a dev dependency...</p><p>If you encounter this problem while following the next video, simply change your start script in your package.json from</p><p><code>nodemon server.js</code></p><p>To</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums"> "scripts": {<br>    "start": "node server.js",<br>    "start:dev": "nodemon server.js"<br>    .....    <br>  },</pre><p>and everything should work as expected!
