Depending on cultures, economic situations and other factors not all of this may apply. Use this not as the only method, but as a source for ideas: </h4><p>You are using the interviewer’s time. Don’t make this a boring meeting. Bring the energy and have a two way conversation with them. They don’t want to be sitting with a scared interviewer that is low energy and can’t hold a conversation without questions.<br></p><p>Prepare a final closing argument. Most people get intimidated my interviews and especially technical ones. However, the first and last impressions are what most interviewers remember. Start the first interaction with high energy and politeness. At the end, no matter how well the interview goes, conclude with something that touches all of these points:</p><p><em>A. Don’t overuse the word “I”</em></p><p><em>B. Talk about the interviewer</em></p><p><em>C. Express to them how much better you are than everyone else</em></p><p><em>D. don’t brag (see point C)</em></p><p><strong>Here is an example:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Well thank you for your time. I am sure you have lots of candidates to see, but I wanted to say one last thing: There are no shortages of developers for you to interview. However, there is a shortage of good, talented, egoless, developers with ambition to learn. The best developers aren’t the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders. It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong. I may not be the most experienced developer that you will interview, but the one thing that you can guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his/her skills every day, play nicely with other developers, and isn’t so narrow minded in problem solving that he/she isn’t willing to try new novel ideas. When you hire me you will rest assured that you won’t have to micromanage me, you don’t have to extinguish fires, and in one year, I will be one of your most valuable employees. I am at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I can grow with and I have chosen “NameOfCompany” for this specific reason. You have probably had similar experience in your career when one company allowed you to really have an impact. I am at that stage now, and I look forward to be part of this team. Thank you.</p></blockquote><p>It may sound a little intense, but who would you hire: A developer that did pretty well at an interview and blends in with all of the other interviews you have done? Or the developer who wanted it more than any of the others?</p><p>Write an email afterwards to the people who have interviewed you. Thank them, and if there were any technical challenges that you couldn’t answer during the interview, reply and let them know that you have looked at the problem and this is the solution (hopefully you were able to figure it out by this point in the comfort of your home and google). Ask them in this letter when you should expect an answer.</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
