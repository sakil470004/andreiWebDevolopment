Each month the challenge is selected to improve a specific part of what it takes to be a great developer. These challenges will sometimes come with awesome prizes as well! If you are looking for extra practice, project ideas, or want to keep your skills up to date, I recommend you keep an eye out on the announcement email from Udemy, or follow the <strong>#coding-challenge</strong> channel on Discord.&nbsp;<br><br>I also recommend you try some of the past challenges while comparing your code to other students from this course. You can find all of the challenges that <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/community/?utm_source=udemy&amp;utm_medium=coursecontent" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>have happened in the past, including the current one you can join here</strong></a>.</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
